[00:01.31] Another wander in the night
[00:04.72] Let me paint the view
[00:06.89] Color the town with my light
[00:11.20] For every moment shared with you
[00:13.06] Not out in the day
[00:15.85] You're never fully gone
[00:18.25] Goin' to be back again
[00:22.26] Until the comin' of a dawn
[00:35.26] 
[00:49.38] Two hands meet at zenith
[00:51.93] Nothin' comes between us
[00:54.83] Dancin' like ballerinas
[00:57.23] Under the moonlight all night long
[01:00.48] How these plain and simple scenes
[01:03.04] Get painted so vividly by you?
[01:09.30] I just wanna stay with you
[01:22.30] 
[01:11.13] Around the world, we slowly dance
[01:14.33] Whenever our eyes meet
[01:16.69] You know you'll leave me in a trance
[01:20.97] It means everything to me
[01:22.76] Lookin' down below
[01:25.40] I'll always seem to find
[01:27.73] No matter where you might go
[01:32.08] Remember you'll be on my mind
[01:55.77] Within the inner heart, I plead
[01:58.86] For you to talk to me
[02:01.43] I wanna hear all the good and bad
[02:04.35] The new stories you have
[02:06.84] As I drift across the sky
[02:09.80] The hour hand turns high
[02:12.47] So goodnight, let me sing a lullaby
[02:24.07] I'll be singin', baby
